# 🧠 geek-php-laravel-backend-engineering

A Structured, Mentor-Driven Backend Engineering Program

- Learn the fundamentals.
- Apply them weekly.
- Build systems that educate, scale, and last.

This repository is a full backend engineering learning system — not just course notes.
It is designed to take learners from PHP beginner → Laravel professional through hands-on practice, mentorship, and real-world workflows.

## 🚀 What This Repository Is

### This repo serves as:

📘 A complete 12-week backend curriculum

🧪 A weekly assignment & geek-task system

👨‍🎓 A student submission tracker

👨‍🏫 A mentor review & feedback workspace

⚙️ An automation-powered learning platform

Everything is structured to simulate how real engineering teams learn, build, and review code.

### 🧠 Learning Philosophy (Geek Way)

>Frameworks don’t make engineers.
>Fundamentals + practice do.

### This program is built on:

- Progressive difficulty

- Industry-focused use cases

- Mandatory applied tasks

- Mentor feedback loops

- Clean Git workflows

No rushing. No shortcuts. No copy-paste learning.

### 🗂 Repository Structure (High-Level)

```bash
├── weeks/              # Official weekly curriculum (Week 1 – 12)
├── students/           # Student submissions (one folder per student)
├── mentors/            # Mentor guidelines & reviews
├── resources/          # PHP, Laravel & best-practice references

├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md

├── init-course-structure.sh
├── init-geek-task.sh
├── create-student.sh
└── README.md
```

This structure enforces consistency, accountability, and scalability.

### 🗓 Curriculum Overview (12 Weeks)
Phase	Focus
- Weeks 1–5	PHP fundamentals → pure PHP systems
- Weeks 6–11	Laravel, MVC, databases, APIs & security
- Week 12	Capstone project (design → delivery)

#### 📌 Full breakdown available in
👉 COURSE-CURRICULUM.md

#### 📁 Weekly Learning Model

Each week follows the same predictable structure:

```bash
week-XX-topic/
├── notes/          # Learning material
├── assignments/    # Practice tasks
├── geek-task/      # Mandatory applied challenge
├── project/        # Weekly mini-project
└── mentor-review/  # Feedback & evaluation
```

This repetition builds discipline and confidence.

### 👨‍🎓 Student Workflow

Fork the repository

Get onboarded (see STUDENT-ONBOARDING.md)

A personal folder is created inside students/

Weekly work is submitted inside:

students/<your-name>/week-XX/


Submit via Pull Request

Automated checks run

Mentor reviews & feedback are added

📌 Students never edit curriculum files — only their own folder.

### 👨‍🏫 Mentor Workflow

#### Mentors:

Review student submissions

Use structured feedback templates

Focus on thinking, not just syntax

Track growth week by week

Mentor reviews live in:

mentors/reviews/week-XX/student-name.md

⚙️ Built-In Automation (Geek Level)

This repo includes automation scripts to remove manual overhead:

🛠 Scripts

init-course-structure.sh → bootstrap the entire course

create-student.sh → generate student folders

init-geek-task.sh → scaffold Geek Tasks for any week

### 🤖 CI / GitHub Actions

Submission structure validation

Empty submission detection

Clean PR enforcement

This mirrors real engineering team workflows.
